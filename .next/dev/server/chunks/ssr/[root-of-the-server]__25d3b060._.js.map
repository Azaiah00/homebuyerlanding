This can be detrimental in the offer process since the seller is looking for the most concrete offer and extended contingencies can make them very nervous. Additionally, the lack of speed can be extremely stressful for the purchaser as we work through the waiting game of approval. This is why we recommend using our preferred lenders. If you do not have a financing contingency and cannot qualify for the loan, your deposit is at risk, so make sure you discuss your options with your lender and your agent as you navigate this decision.\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"offer-component-card\">\n              <div className=\"component-icon\"><Building size={32} /></div>\n              <div className=\"component-content\">\n              <h3 className=\"component-title\">HOA/Condo Association</h3>\n              <p className=\"component-description\">\n                If you're buying a condominium or a home in a community with a Homeowners Association (HOA), understanding the association and its fees is crucial to your home buying decision.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"component-description\">\n                <strong>HOA/Condo Fees:</strong> These monthly or annual fees cover shared expenses like maintenance of common areas, amenities (pools, gyms, landscaping), insurance for common areas, and reserve funds for future repairs.

Understanding these fees and rules upfront helps you make an informed decision and avoid surprises after closing.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"component-description\">\n                <strong>Document Review Period/Contingency:</strong> When you're under contract, you have a specific period to review all HOA/Condo association documents, including bylaws, rules, financial statements, and meeting minutes.

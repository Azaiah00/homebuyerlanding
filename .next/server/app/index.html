Rate buy-downs are particularly powerful as they can significantly reduce your monthly payment.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>When It Makes Sense:</strong> Seller subsidy is most viable in markets with less competition, when a property has been on the market for a while, or when the seller is motivated. Even in competitive markets, a well-structured offer with a rate buy-down can stand out. <strong>As your realtor, I&#x27;ll assess each situation to determine if seller subsidy is a viable strategy for your offer.</strong></p></div></div><div class="offer-component-card"><div class="component-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-search" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m21 21-4.34-4.34"></path><circle cx="11" cy="11" r="8"></circle></svg></div><div class="component-content"><h3 class="component-title">Home Inspection <span class="tooltip-trigger" data-tooltip="Contingency: A condition in your offer that must be met for the sale to proceed.

This contingency protects you from buying a home with hidden problems.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>Appraisal Contingency:</strong> This protects you if the home appraises for less than your offer price. The lender requires an appraisal to ensure the property is worth the loan amount.</p><p class="component-description">If the appraisal comes in low, you can renegotiate the price, make up the difference in cash, or walk away from the deal. This ensures you&#x27;re not overpaying for the property.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Both contingencies are crucial protections, but shorter contingency periods can make your offer more competitive in hot markets. <strong>As your realtor, I&#x27;ll help you balance protection with competitiveness.</strong></p><p class="component-note"><strong>Bonus: Home Warranty</strong> - A home warranty provides extra protection for your investment and can save you money in case of future emergencies.

This can be detrimental in the offer process since the seller is looking for the most concrete offer and extended contingencies can make them very nervous. Additionally, the lack of speed can be extremely stressful for the purchaser as we work through the waiting game of approval. This is why we recommend using our preferred lenders. If you do not have a financing contingency and cannot qualify for the loan, your deposit is at risk, so make sure you discuss your options with your lender and your agent as you navigate this decision.</div></div></div><div class="offer-component-card"><div class="component-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-building" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 10h.01"></path><path d="M12 14h.01"></path><path d="M12 6h.01"></path><path d="M16 10h.01"></path><path d="M16 14h.01"></path><path d="M16 6h.01"></path><path d="M8 10h.01"></path><path d="M8 14h.01"></path><path d="M8 6h.01"></path><path d="M9 22v-3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1h4a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v3"></path><rect x="4" y="2" width="16" height="20" rx="2"></rect></svg></div><div class="component-content"><h3 class="component-title">HOA/Condo Association</h3><p class="component-description">If you&#x27;re buying a condominium or a home in a community with a Homeowners Association (HOA), understanding the association and its fees is crucial to your home buying decision.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>HOA/Condo Fees:</strong> These monthly or annual fees cover shared expenses like maintenance of common areas, amenities (pools, gyms, landscaping), insurance for common areas, and reserve funds for future repairs. Fees can range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars per month, depending on the community and amenities offered.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> HOA fees directly impact your monthly housing costs and affordability. They also govern what you can and cannot do with your property through rules, regulations, and covenants. Understanding these fees and rules upfront helps you make an informed decision and avoid surprises after closing.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>Document Review Period/Contingency:</strong> When you&#x27;re under contract, you have a specific period to review all HOA/Condo association documents, including bylaws, rules, financial statements, and meeting minutes. This review period is a critical contingency that allows you to understand the association&#x27;s financial health, rules, and any pending special assessments.</p><p class="component-description"><strong>Review Periods by State:</strong> In DC and MD, you have <strong>3 business days</strong> to review HOA/Condo documents. In Virginia, you have <strong>3 days</strong> (calendar days) for both HOA and Condo document review periods when under contract. During this time, you can review the documents and decide if you want to proceed with the purchase or withdraw from the contract.</p></div></div></div><div class="offer-cta-box"><p class="offer-cta-text">Ready to craft your winning offer?

VA loans typically require 620+. However, higher scores get better interest rates. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll connect you with trusted lenders who can review your specific situation and help improve your credit if needed. <strong>Ask me more about credit score requirements and how to improve yours.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>What is PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) and when do I need it?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">PMI is insurance that protects the lender if you default on your loan.

PMI usually costs 0.5% to 1% of your loan amount annually and can be removed once you reach 20% equity. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll help you understand your PMI options and when it makes sense to pay it. <strong>Ask me more about PMI and how to minimize or avoid it.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>Can I buy a home if I have student loans or other debt?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">Yes! Having debt doesn&#x27;t automatically disqualify you. Lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which should typically be below 43% for most loans. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll connect you with trusted lenders who can help you understand your options and find the right loan program for your situation. <strong>Ask me more about how we can work together to get you approved.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>Should I get a home inspection?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">Absolutely! A home inspection is one of the most important steps in the buying process. It reveals potential issues with the property&#x27;s structure, systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), and safety concerns. Even in competitive markets, an inspection contingency protects you from buying a home with hidden problems. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll help you find a qualified inspector and negotiate repairs if issues are found. <strong>Ask me more about home inspections and how they protect you.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>What happens if the home doesn&#x27;t appraise for the purchase price?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">If the appraisal comes in lower than your offer price, you have several options: renegotiate the price with the seller, make up the difference in cash, or walk away from the deal (if you have an appraisal contingency). This is why an appraisal contingency is crucial—it protects you from overpaying. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll help you navigate this situation and negotiate the best outcome. <strong>Ask me more about appraisal contingencies and how they protect you.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>Can I negotiate the price after the inspection?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">Yes! If the inspection reveals issues, you can negotiate with the seller to either lower the price, have them make repairs, or provide a credit at closing. The key is having an inspection contingency in your offer. As your realtor, I&#x27;ll help you determine which issues are worth negotiating and craft a strategy that protects your interests while keeping the deal together. <strong>Ask me more about inspection negotiations.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>What should I look for when viewing homes?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">Focus on the home&#x27;s condition, layout, location, and potential issues.

As your realtor, I&#x27;ll point out red flags and help you evaluate each property objectively. <strong>Ask me more about what to look for during home viewings.</strong></p></div></div><div class="faq-bar "><button class="faq-question-bar"><span>How many homes should I view before making an offer?</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-down faq-icon" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button><div class="faq-answer-content"><p class="faq-answer">There&#x27;s no magic number, but most buyers view 10-15 homes before making an offer.

It&#x27;s not required, but it can provide peace of mind and save you money on unexpected repairs. Some sellers offer a home warranty as part of the sale.
